# Markov Process Tools for ISEN 340

In this repository is the *MarkovChain.py* module developed for ISEN 340 (Operations Research II) taught by Mark Lawley at Texas A&M University.
It is loaded with useful functions and classes that help in understanding and computing the concepts covered in this course.

I highly recommend checking out the *MarkovChain_examples.ipynb* notebook for a tutorial on how to use everything.
